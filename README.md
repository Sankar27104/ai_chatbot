# 🧠 AI Chatbot using Tkinter and Hugging Face Transformers

This project is a simple **AI-powered chatbot** application built with **Python Tkinter** for the GUI and **Hugging Face's Transformers** for the AI model backend.  
It uses Microsoft's **DialoGPT-small** model to generate human-like responses to user inputs in real time.

## 📚 Features

- Chat with an AI model in a simple desktop GUI.
- Interactive **Tkinter** interface with a scrollable chat window.
- Uses **pre-trained DialoGPT** model from Hugging Face.
- Easy to extend and customize for other AI models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Transformers Library (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch (backend for model execution)
